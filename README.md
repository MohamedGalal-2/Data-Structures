### What does data structure mean?
Data structures refer to a particular way of organizing and manipulating data in a computer so that it can be efficiently accessed and manipulated. It provides a way to store and organize data in memory in a way that allows for efficient access, insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations.

Data structures are designed to optimize the use of computer memory and processing power, reducing the complexity or optimizing the efficiency of various operations performed on data. They define rules and mechanisms for organizing and storing data in a computer's memory, which allows for quick and efficient access and manipulation of the data.

### Prerequisites
Before running any of the implementations, make sure you have the required environment set up for the specific programming language. Each implementation folder contains its own set of instructions on how to run or compile the code.

### Repository Structure
This repository contains the following data structures implementation in C:
1. Static Stack Based on Array
2. Dynamic Stack Based on Array
3. Singly Linked List
4. Doubly Linked List
5. Dynamic Circular Queue

### Contributing
Contributions to this repository are always welcome. If you have any improvements or new implementations, feel free to submit a pull request. Please make sure to follow the contribution guidelines before submitting your changes.

### License
This repository is to train myself on implementing some of the Data Structures using C. Feel free to use and modify the code as per your requirements.
