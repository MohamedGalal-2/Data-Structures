### What does data structure mean
Data structures refer to a particular way of organizing and manipulating data in a computer so that it can be efficiently accessed and manipulated. It provides a way to store and organize data in memory in a way that allows for efficient access, insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations.

Data structures are designed to optimize the use of computer memory and processing power, reducing the complexity or optimizing the efficiency of various operations performed on data. They define rules and mechanisms for organizing and storing data in a computer's memory, which allows for quick and efficient access and manipulation of the data.

### Getting Started
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Install C runtime environment on your system such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Microsoft Visual C++, or any other C development environment based on your operating system.

2. Clone the repository using the following command:

        git clone https://github.com/MohamedGalal-2/Grokking-Algorithms.git

3. Navigate to the desired chapter's directory:

        cd Grokking-Algorithms/"Chapter x"
  
4. Run the source files using the your desired IDE and Compiler.
